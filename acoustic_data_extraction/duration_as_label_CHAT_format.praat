#						 DESCRIPTION
#
# 	This script is designed to batch process several TextGrid files 
#	contained in a folder. The main purpose of this script is 
#	to automatically extract the duration of given intervals in a specified 
#	tier within each TextGrid file and then replace the label of the interval 
#	with the corresponding duration value. The duration of given intervals is 
#	rounded, expressed in seconds and written between parenthesis as "(0.01)" 
#	which follows the CHAT format proposed by MacWhinney, B. (2000). 
#   The CHILDES Project: Tools for Analyzing Talk. 3rd Edition. 
#   Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.
#	
#						IMPORTANT NOTES 
#	Do not write " " in the interval label form unless the label 
#	contains " " in the original TextGrid, otherwise the script will 
#	not work as intended.
