#
#			             DESCRIPTION
#
#	This Praat script allows you to easily 
#   remove tiers in a TextGrid file.  
#   The script provides a user-friendly form that allows users 
#   to input the directory where the TextGrid files are stored, 
#   the index of the tier they want to remove, and the directory 
#   where the modified files should be saved.
#
#
#                       IMPORTANT NOTE 
#   It is essential to be aware that if a TextGrid file 
#   contains only one tier, the script will execute without errors; 
#   however, Praat will not allow the removal of that single tier. 
#   This limitation exists because a TextGrid file must have at least 
#   one tier to be considered valid in Praat. 
#
#   If you attempt to remove the last tier, Praat will retain it, 
#   and the file will remain unaltered. In such cases, users may 
#   consider creating a new tier or modifying the existing 
#   tier's content rather than attempting to remove it.
